  "reviews": "&quot;AI War breaks most of the genre’s rules. Which is precisely why it’s incredible… This out-of-the-blue one-man passion project is one of this year’s finest strategy games.&quot;<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/ai-war/review/ai-war/a-20091005104351651002/g-20091005102715123063\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Alec Meer, PC Gamer UK, November 2009</a><br><br>It’s a balancing act, with your own strength on one side, and the AI’s opinion of you on the other. Piss it off before you’re ready to face it, and you’re going to get squashed. That moment, when you’re finally in a position to turn the tables, is about as glorious as gaming gets.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-02-14-ai-war-fleet-command-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Phill Cameron, Eurogamer, February 2011</a><br><br>I think I’ve stumbled across this year’s Really New Thing. There’s a lot of 2009 to go, but I’ll be surprised if anyone else twists the RTS formula this dramatically and this effectively. And I’m hoping it’ll be the Next Big Thing, because it’s big, different, entirely unprecedented and an exciting way to play an RTS.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.crispygamer.com/columns/2009-08-13/rush-boom-turtle-and-now-for-something-completely-different.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Tom Chick, Crispy Gamer, August 2009</a><br><br>Having played this title at two distinct points in its life cycle what really stands out is the incredible dedication of Arcen Games in keeping on top of how the game evolves and expands. Even though a great many features have been added and tweaked and refined, it was possible for me to drop back into AI War after more than a year away and not find it to be a confusing mish-mash of feature overload. The post-release support is, quite honestly, the best I’ve seen for any game.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.incgamers.com/2011/02/ai-war-light-of-the-spire-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Peter Parrish, IncGamers, February 2011</a><br><br>AI War is, quite simply, the best experience you could have with co-op or single-player real-time strategy in this or any year. It combines grand strategy with emergent AI to form an excellent game perfect for parties and multiplayer. It is easily worth double the price that the developer is selling it at, and anyone with any affinity or taste for strategy games should not miss it. It may be daunting at first, but an excellent tutorial and amazing gameplay mechanics alleviate this into a game that almost anyone can - and should - play.<br>- <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://news.bigdownload.com/2009/11/03/review-a-i-war-fleet-command/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >James Murff, Big Download, November 2009</a>",

In addition to the addicting gameplay, Planets under Attack is an obvious labor of love. An exciting and memorable cast of characters exist perfectly in this artistically beautiful world. From the ships to the planets, everything has an essence of its own, with a memorable soundtrack and comical sound effects breathing life into the visuals<br>The goal of this challenging space adventure is to conquer a galaxy of planets, while undertaking a multitude of special challenges. Take control of your mighty space armada, and wreak havoc across the cosmos, but choose your targets wisely! Conquered planets will net you income to expand your forces, but you must carefully weigh the pros and cons of attacking each planet, as timing and available resources are critical to victory. Above all else, you must keep a cool head. Enemies race to capture your territory as you hone in on theirs and multiple battles will rage on all fronts. You must make tactical decisions at every turn, from scouting your enemies and deploying units, to shoring up your planets’ defenses and knowing when to attack and when to defend. Strategic multi-tasking and a keen military mind will lead directly to unrivaled glory…while careless play will reduce your army to space dust.<br>The Campaign mode tests your military might with 32 thrilling levels, each with varied planets, tasks and game modes. Defend a planet until reinforcements arrive, fly into uncharted space, conquer planets and set up defenses before rivals attack - the list goes on and on, as there is no shortage of objectives in your struggle for interstellar dominance. Start out as a novice and learn the ropes, or ramp up the challenge with three levels of difficulty. The longer you play the more experience you’ll obtain, allowing you to unlock new technologies, changing the way you play and ensuring you’ll keep coming back for more!<br><strong>Online</strong><br>In Online mode, don’t just choose your own path, make the cosmos your own personal battleground! You design the fight, from choosing the amount of players, to selecting your maps. Simply pick a game mode, select your settings, grab some friends, and cut loose.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Impressive moving planetary systems in a three dimensional space<br></li><li>Stunning cartoon graphics<br></li><li>Fun, easy to learn gameplay in a rich science-fiction setting<br></li><li>8 types of planets<br></li><li>A diverse campaign with 32 levels and multiple game modes<br></li><li>15 multiplayer levels for 2-4 players – either in Online mode against other players, Skirmish mode against the A.I., or work towards the same goals and team-up with players in Team mode.<br></li><li>Same system multiplayer – allowing players to play with up to 4 people at once, all on the same system, and in any mode they choose.<br></li><li>15 unlockable technologies provide gameplay variety in both single and multiplayer modes<br></li><li>2 playable races with unique ship designs and gameplay variants</li></ul>",

For each objective captured, they gain more reinforcement and time to attack the next. Defenders have a finite amount of reinforcements and must use each wisely. Once the third objective is captured by the attackers, a fourth cache objective must be destroyed, while the defenders have only one life to make a last stand.<br><br><i>Firefight</i> --- Three territorial objectives, one for each team, plus one neutral. Each team only respawns when they secure an objective. Secure all objectives or eliminate all enemy to win. Every life counts, making this a very suspenseful experience dependent upon teamwork.<br><br><i>Skirmish</i> --- In addition to three territorial objectives, each team has a supply cache to protect. Teams gain extra reinforcement waves until their cache is destroyed. When both teams have lost their caches and all reinforcement waves, it becomes a Firefight match.<br><br><i>Occupy</i> --- There is one central territorial objective in the area. The team that controls it does not deplete reinforcement waves. This gameplay in this mode is reminiscent to King of the Hill or &quot;tug of war&quot;.<br><br><i>Ambush</i> --- A high value target (&quot;HVT&quot;) must be escorted to an extraction point. It's one team's goal to make this happen and it's the other team's goal to stop this from happening at all costs. The HVT is only armed with a silenced pistol, but can pick up a weapon from a fallen enemy or teammate.<br><br><i>Strike</i> --- Three weapon caches must be destroyed by the attacking team to achieve victory. Destroying a cache earns the attackers more reinforcements and time on the clock. The defenders must retain at least one cache from being destroyed and eliminate the enemy team once their reinforcements run dry.<br><br><i>Infiltrate</i> --- The standard Capture the Flag mode, but with a twist. Your team's goal is to take the enemy's intel and return it to your base. Your team will only gain reinforcements when someone takes the enemy's intel, or when an enemy stealing your team's intel is neutralized. This mode requires very strong team coordination and strategy.<br><br><i>Flashpoint</i> --- One neutral territorial objective and two caches on each side. The goal is to secure the entire area, controlling the middle and destroying the enemy's caches. Your team respawns when they secure the territorial objective or destroy a cache objective.<br><br><i>Elimination</i> --- In this single life mode, attackers must destroy one of two weapon caches, or eliminate the enemy team within the time limit. Defenders must kill all attackers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cooperative Game Modes</h2><br><i>Checkpoint</i> --- Complete mission-based objectives in sequence against AI enemy. Each successful objective will respawn anyone who was eliminated along the way.<br><br><i>Hunt</i> --- Insurgents are dispersed in the environment, and your squad must eliminate all targets while locating and destroying the weapons cache. High on tension, with only one-life.<br><br><i>Survival</i> --- Play as Insurgents and fight against endless waves of progressively difficult Security enemies on night themed maps. Reaching safehouse objectives with your team earns you supply to purchase better weapons and spawns any dead teammates.<br><br><i>Outpost</i> --- Defend your supply cache against endless waves of enemy trying to destroy it. Each successfully defended wave will bring in reinforcements of your teammates.<br><br><i>Conquer</i> --- Capture the objectives in the area and defend them from enemy trying to retake them. Destroy enemy weapon caches to thin out their numbers.",

Cook, Serve, Delicious: Battle Kitchen Edition is a brand new free expansion that provides all new local multiplayer modes and weekly challenges! From 25 indie guest cameos to tons of new features and improvements, CSD: Battle Kitchen will challenge even the most hardened cook. Some of the new features include:<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Tag Team Local Multiplayer</strong>- Grab some controllers and play up to four players locally as you take turns manning the chef station in Battle Kitchen. You only have fifteen seconds to cook, and five seconds to explain to the next cook what to do first! Good luck!<br></li><li><strong>Strike Challenges</strong>- Take on twelve brand new challenges on your own or up to four players tag team with adjustable difficulty settings. Warning: these challenges can be extremely difficult!<br></li><li><strong>Endurance Mode</strong>- For one player or up to four Tag Team players, Endurance Mode has you making as many foods as possible perfectly, all while having to answer Chef Risotto's calls and switching out menu items and upgrading them while you're cooking. How long can you last? Also includes the new eSports Endurance Challenge, an event that ups the difficulty to an extreme degree!<br></li><li><strong>Co-op Campaign</strong>- Play the campaign mode with a friend using your current save! One person is the expediter, who must give orders to the chef and send them out when they're fully cooked, and the other is the chef, unable to choose orders but must cook or do anything the expediter gives them. Tag each other to switch positions on the fly, and make your way from a zero star cafe to a five star restaurant! (co-op can be enabled or disabled at any time in the main menu of the campaign mode).<br></li><li><strong>Game Improvements</strong>- A huge array of game improvements and additions have been added to the game!

  "short_description": "One of the few hardcore restaurant sims in existence, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a deceptively easy game to learn but incredibly challenging to master as you progress through your career from owning a terrible zero star cafe into a five star world famous restaurant.",
  "supported_languages": "English",
  "reviews": "“Along with being one of the (very unexpectedly!) funniest games I’ve played this year, the game’s disarming &amp; charming aesthetic did not prepare me for what is undoubtedly the best WarioWare-like game I have ever played. In fact, I probably ended up spending more time with Cook, Serve, Delicious! than with almost any other game this year. The gameplay is simple in nature but blisteringly fast, resulting in a challenge that is more than enough to keep the average player interested. The game does not overstay its welcome, as it evolves in numerous ingenious ways by the time you’ve reached the end.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://thestereogram.com/2013/02/cook-serve-delicious-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Stereogram</a><br><br>“It's not an easy game to excel at, but it's an easy game to get hooked on, and the challenge of building and running your own restaurant from front to back is going to captivate you for weeks on end...with depth to rival a strategy game and carefully controlled chaos ruling the action sequences, Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a rare release that encourages you to play until you master every nuance of gameplay.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://jayisgames.com/archives/2012/11/cook_serve_delicious.php\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Jay Is Games</a><br><br>“Cook, Serve, Delicious! is fast paced, engaging, and absolutely addictive for foodies or non-foodies alike. Don’t be fooled by the cute cartoonish style because you’ll find your eyeballs popping and button mashing like mad after a few hours.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://vividgamer.com/2013/09/02/cook-serve-delicious-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Vivid Gamer</a><br>",

Brought to fruition by a team of experts and a community of hundreds of fans, Panzer Corps - Wehrmacht has evolved into the ultimate strategy classic that will find a home on any wargamer’s shelf! <br><br>Set in World War II, Panzer Corps - Wehrmacht puts players in the general’s tent in charge of the Axis armies, across 26 scenarios in one large campaign tree, carrying core forces through the war. This core force can gain experience and upgrade to new weaponry as it becomes available. With over 800 unit types, divided into 20 unit classes there is a huge amount to explore.

We are the masters of our destinies, Always Sometimes Monsters says – but we can't control other people's lives. That's where it gets tricky.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/06/03/always-sometimes-monsters-review-being-human/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Joystiq</a><br><br>“It's an earnest look at life under tough economic pressure, at love when things don't go according to plan and at a creative career during its shittiest lows. It has a lot to say, and importantly, it speaks from the heart.”<br>8/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/5/5765838/always-sometimes-monsters-review-working-class-hero\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Polygon</a><br><br>“Always Sometimes Monsters isn't the first game to get clever with morality. It's not the first game that's had a few grey areas. It also isn't about either of those. It's about perspective. It's about empathy. It's about who we are and why we do what we do. That narrative is one of contradiction and hypocrisy, because that's what real people are about.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-21-always-sometimes-monsters-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br>",

Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u> (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u> (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins, Inc.</strong></u> – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u> strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The game offers a <u>diverse resource system</u> that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The multilayer mode of the game features a system of <u>ratings</u>, <u>ladders</u> and <u>ranked sessions</u>: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives <u>FREE content and feature updates</u> (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items, new music). We are committed to continue developing this product – based on player feedback!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Additionally, the game offers over 10 <u>single-player challenges</u> plus the option to create <u>custom single-player sessions</u> with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, there's the <u>team mode</u> where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore15.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FACTS &amp; FIGURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>185 cards in the main deck</u> (149 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>39 events in the Misfortune deck</u>: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>6 special Chaos Cards</u>: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>12 sets of Character Abilities</u>: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>11 original locations</u>: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and <u>7 original spot types</u>: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>2 distinctly different playing fields</u>: The Clockwork Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their own.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, the game took us <strong>three years</strong> to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently <strong>over 150 000 players</strong> of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players already launched <i>several millions</i> game sessions!</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore09.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?</strong></h2><br>You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>, <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun <i>cosmetic</i> content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase. However, there is absolutely no pressure to own any of the DLCs in order to play the game or compete in the tournaments. Every player, whether they have DLCs or not, has access to the same game features and the same game mechanics.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STEAM COMMUNITY MARKET, CRAFTING AND ITEM STORE</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. features <u>in-game items</u> and fully supports <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. While playing the game, certain actions will trigger random chest drops with items of varying rarity: it could be a new emoticon, a new profile background, a new music track, or one of the dozens of other cosmetic items. These items are FREE, yours to use or trade on <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/market/search?appid=369990\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Community Market</a>. We, the developer, do not engage in the direct sales of any drop items; only players can trade them.<br><br>The game also supports <u>crafting</u>: once you find a blueprint of a specific item, you can create as many such items as you wish, as long as you have the required number of charges (you get charges when you convert other in-game items that you do not want, or have multiple copies of). Finally, the game has its own <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/369990/browse/?filter=all\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Steam Item Store</a> where we sell a very small number of unique items that influence the item meta-game (but they have no effect on the game mechanics).<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore21.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>ONLINE &amp; OFFLINE VERSIONS</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. was designed as a digital board game with the multiplayer mode at its heart. However, this is not to say that we don't like single-player – we do, and there's a separate section with the single-player challenges as well as the mode where you can create any custom single-player session that you like! One of the products that you receive with this game, <strong><u>Gremlins, Inc.</u></strong>, features both single-player and multiplayer modes, and requires that your game client is connected to both Steam and the game's server at all times – in order to support item drops, Steam Community Market and Steam Workshop. The other product that is included with the game, <strong><u>Gremlins vs Automatons</u></strong>, features single-player mode and is designed specifically to be played offline.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>AMSTERDAM AND SINGAPORE SERVERS</strong></h2><br>The game currently supports 2 separate servers: Amsterdam and Singapore. Players are able to check their ping value for each of these servers, and play on the server that is the most convenient. Each server has its own player ladder, statistics and player profiles. Most players choose Amsterdam, since ping to Amsterdam from anywhere in the world rarely exceeds 300. However, as we saw more and more players from the Asian region join the game, especially from China, we added the server in Singapore in order to be able to offer faster connection specifically to these players. We hope that this works well for every player, as good player experience is our top priority. We will continue to monitor the quality of our server/client connection in order to adapt the servers to the changing requirements and we thank you for your patience.",
  "about_the_game": "<img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore05.png?t=1553877973\" ><br>This is an intense strategy board game in a steampunk world of corrupt capitalist gremlins who compete for money, political power and prestige. Save and invest, steal and extort, arrest and get arrested – in single-player and multiplayer, with ranks and ladders, team mode and spectator mode. Featuring seasonal content updates, regular tournaments, item drops, full support of Steam Community Market – and more!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS GAME?</strong></h2><br>Gremlins, Inc. is designed for up to 6 players, in <u>multiplayer</u> or in <u>single-player</u> mode (with AI bots). Each player has 6 cards on their hand (replenished from the same deck) and uses them either to move around the playing field or to perform different game actions. There is a lot of interaction with other players, and duels are significantly different from 3-player or 4-player games. You can play until a certain score limit, or until agreed number of rounds, or for time limit. The game offers both <u>custom</u> and <u>ranked</u> sessions (with matchmaking by rating).<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY IN TEAMS OR JUST WATCH?</strong></h2><br>Yes, you can! In addition to <u>custom sessions</u> (where you define the parameters of the session and may optionally set filters for those who can join you) and password-protected <u>private sessions</u> (so that you and your friends can play undisturbed), the game offers <u>team mode</u> (2x2, 3x3, or 2x2x2) with teams of human players and/or AI bots. Gremlins, Inc. also supports a built-in <u>spectator mode</u>, which allows you to watch sessions of other players right from inside of the game, sharing your emotions with players and other spectators through messages and emoticons.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CAN YOU PLAY THIS GAME OFFLINE?</strong></h2><br>Certainly! When you buy this game, you get 2 products in your Steam Library: <u><strong>Gremlins, Inc.</strong></u> – the edition that is playable online in single-player and multiplayer modes, with full support of item drops and Steam Workshop; and <u><strong>Gremlins vs Automatons</strong></u> – the edition that is playable offline in single-player mode, without any connection to our server whatsoever.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO PLAY ONE SESSION?</strong></h2><br>The game offers different session settings to make them fit your available time, and single-player mode offers automatic <u>SAVE / LOAD</u> function at every turn so that you can take a break whenever you want (while multiplayer mode offers re-connect functionality as long as the session is still in progress). A quick duel for 20 score points with a fast timer can finish in under 20 minutes, while a 4-player session for 60 rounds can last for 2 hours or more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM STRATEGIES?</strong></h2><br>There are different types of cards in the game (permanent, regular, secret and criminal) and as each card can be used either to move or for action, you will develop both <u>short-term</u> and <u>long-term</u> strategies for making the most out of where you are, and what you currently have in your hand. Normally, you spend half of your game time accumulating resources and building the foundation for the end-game, and the other half trying to control the progress of your opponents (stealing, arresting, initiating player conflicts, and so on). The more you play, the more new strategies you will discover – especially when combining the effects of several cards played in a combination.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/StorePage07.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>MAKE DECISIONS, PLAN YOUR MOVES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>This is an intense <u>strategy game</u>: make decisions at every round! Plan your moves, then adjust to the actions of the other players and new cards drawn.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The design of the playing field and the multiple layers of optional features (that you can turn on or off, as you wish) allow for a variety of strategies. The more you play, the more roads to victory you discover, using a combination of features based on the particular setup of the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The game offers a <u>diverse resource system</u> that allows for many comeback chances even after you're robbed or arrested (or both). With score, money, votes, malice, income and bribes, the tension often remains until the very last round.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>The multilayer mode of the game features a system of <u>ratings</u>, <u>ladders</u> and <u>ranked sessions</u>: compete in a specific league, and take part in the regularly organised tournaments with over 1 000 participants. A system of anonymous masks allows everyone to compete on equal terms in a ranked session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Every season since its release in 2016, the game receives <u>FREE content and feature updates</u> (balancing changes, new cards, new in-game items, new music). We are committed to continue developing this product – based on player feedback!</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Additionally, the game offers over 10 <u>single-player challenges</u> plus the option to create <u>custom single-player sessions</u> with different settings and a different mix of AI bots.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, there's the <u>team mode</u> where victory is determined not only by strategic skill, but also by communication and coordination of each team, which is an entirely different layer of game mechanics.</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore15.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FACTS &amp; FIGURES</strong></h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>185 cards in the main deck</u> (149 of them – unique): permanent, regular, secret and criminal, each with a hand-drawn steampunk illustration; with each Season update, we keep adding several new cards to the deck.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>39 events in the Misfortune deck</u>: these are the special events triggered at certain moments in the game, and may affect the current standing of all players to a significant degree, especially when used on a specific opponent.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>6 special Chaos Cards</u>: this is an optional set of cards available to every player in the game; turn them on or off to change the dynamics of the session.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>12 sets of Character Abilities</u>: another optional feature that brings to the game special game mechanics unique to each character type; playing with these makes different competing strategies even more pronounced.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>11 original locations</u>: the Office, the Plant, the Dump, the Marketplace, the Inferno, the Jail, the Casino, the Court, the Treasure, the Bank and the Astral Plane; and <u>7 original spot types</u>: Risk, Gamble, Police, Income, Bribe, Misfortune and Tribune.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><u>2 distinctly different playing fields</u>: The Clockwork Town and The Clockwork Colony, each offering strategic challenges of their own.</li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>Finally, the game took us <strong>three years</strong> to develop from concept to full release, and we're still committed to continue supporting the community through development of new content. There are currently <strong>over 150 000 players</strong> of Gremlins, Inc. on Steam from all over the world, including USA, Russia, China, Japan, UK and France. Collectively, players already launched <i>several millions</i> game sessions!</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/369990/extras/SteamStore09.png?t=1553877973\" ><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FINALLY, WHO ARE THE GREMLINS?</strong></h2><br>You think that’s just a pocket watch in your hand, a watch that’s a bit late because you keep forgetting to wind it up? No, no and no – you couldn’t be further from the truth! What you carry around is a whole gremlin town packed into this tiny mechanism: a town with its own bank, its own casino… and even its own jail! Gremlins are the microscopic creatures that inhabit any mechanism that they can possibly infiltrate. If a watch or a telescope malfunctions, then it’s probably due to gremlins who took up a residence there.<br><br>More than anything in life, gremlins value <strong>money</strong>, <strong>political power</strong> and <strong>prestige</strong>: prestige that one can claim after completing some sort of a grandiose engineering project. Aside from working on their own projects, gremlins mostly spend their time preventing other gremlins from building something even more grandiose. This they achieve through bribing officials and lying to the electorate, as well through stealing from their competitors - and outright arresting them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>A DISCLAIMER (JUST IN CASE)</strong></h2><br>We felt it important to note that Gremlins, Inc. is not a free-to-play game. Also, this is not a CCG or TCG: you do not need to buy boosters or packs; in every session the game offers the same deck to every player, and everyone's chances are equal.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>OUR DLC POLICY</strong></h2><br>We are committed to the principle of continuously updating the game with new features and new game content that come as regular updates, FREE to every owner of the product. At the same time, from time to time we release DLCs that feature fun <i>cosmetic</i> content. If you like it, you can support our efforts by your purchase.

The game represents a unique and unforgettable experience as it transports players in a weird town which crouches, ominous, in the far reaches of an ancient steppe. It was once a small drover settlement, huddled around a monstrous abattoir—but something about the butchery it was near has changed it. It has developed an odd social structure over the course of several generations. It could have quietly continued along its weird way, but a sudden outbreak of an unknown and inevitably lethal disease has decimated the citizens. Prayers did not help. Science did not help. So, finally, they have turned to outsiders for help: three of them enter the town in hope of finding a cure or—failing that—an explanation. The first outsider was a ruthless investigator, assigned by local authorities. The second is a far-sighted Ripper who has used his extraordinary abilities to gain a reputation as an ingenious surgeon, who has come to the town in search of his father's terrible heritage. The third—and last—outsider is an eccentric girl rumored to have mystic healing abilities; she may become the town's salvation were it not for the constant fear that plagues her, the memory of the horrors of her recent past.<br><br>On the surface, Pathologic is a first person horror adventure game where you control one of three &quot;heroes.&quot; Dig deeper, however, and you’ll find an experience that will affect your emotional and psychological state. In the world of Pathologic you’ll find yourself in situations where morals and good deeds are meaningless in the face of raw despair and endless need. Talk to the denizens of the town and decide for yourself if you wish to ease someone else’s pain or save every bit of precious medicine to protect yourself from the invisible and inexorable plague.

The player can discover terrain by physically bumping into it, or by performing a double jump. The double jump sprays paint bullets out of the player and increases the player’s awareness of their surroundings. If the player happens to bump into spikes or falls to their death, paint will also shoot out from the player’s last position.

  "detailed_description": "<strong>Tons of Guns - Free Multiplayer Update</strong><br><br>The arms race intensifies with this new update that adds two new tech buildings which allow commanders access to six formidable new weapons, and a host of new and varied strategies. The Armoury unlocks Flak guns to clear the skies of enemy projectiles, and EMP rockets to power down enemy tech, both of which can be upgraded to the Shotgun and twin Rocket launcher, respectively. The classic Cannon is now found in the new Munitions Plant, where it is joined by it's little brother, the burst-firing 20mm Cannon. The Factory now produces two beam weapons, the classic Plasma Laser and the new Firebeam, great for penetrating fortifications to ignite them from within.<br><br>Tons of Guns comes complete with new AI forts bristling with new weapons for players to take on in Skirmish or Multiplayer, and a new Mod Selection feature, which allows several new game types, such as Fast Build, Rapid Fire and Zero Gravity. Also included are Truce mods, which provide a period of varying lengths in which players can build up their forts in peace, before they start blasting each other into oblivion.

  "reviews": "“Brisbane-based Earthwork Games has brought out a fort building - and fort destroying - simulator that combines strategy, engineering, aiming, and micromanagement. It's a fun cocktail that puts me in mind of Scorched Earth, or maybe a Scorched Earth that let me build a bunker around my tank. And then three more tanks on my bunker.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/05/forts-is-a-fun-mix-of-rts-and-worms/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“Forts is an exceptional example of how a release can properly integrate many mechanics, from multiple genres, and get it right. The fast-paced challenge of managing multiple tasks before you’re obliterated creates a sense of urgency and an increased heart rate that you wouldn’t normally find from a title that simply leverages one of these mechanics. Buy Forts, and make a solid investment in your game library.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://opnoobs.com/reviews/indie/strategy/forts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >The Overpowered Noobs</a><br><br>“Forts is a simple, fun game, has a nice sense of humour and is guaranteed to get your brain whirling as you figure out the best way to build your base, defend your weapons while also pelting the enemy with bullets and bombs.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamegrin.com/reviews/forts-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameGrin</a><br>",

Something strange has happened and people everywhere are turning into blood thirsty walking corpses.  But guess who’s the brains behind this hungry undead army? YOU! So spread this pandemic to wipe humanity off this planet. Because the only way to survive the zombie apocalypse, is to BE the apocalypse! <br><br>But the brainless undead are quite dumb… even dumber than you might expect given their lack of grey matter. Because when left to their own devises, they will just endlessly walk forward and fall into permanently deadly booby traps placed by not-so-helpless humans. So to accomplish your mission of world extermination, you will need to help guide them to their next yummy meal.  Luckily you can utilize numerous special mutations to make your troops evolve and fulfil their appetite for flesh. But beware! Humans will not facilitate your dark will….they will fight to survive.<br><br>Spread terror through 40 levels and enrol more zombies into your undead army. Along the way you’ll have to solve brain tingling puzzles, and fight increasingly powerful foes that are hell-bent on staying alive. The closer you get to total world extinction, the harder survivors will fight to put you in the ground….for good.<br><br>Blood, tears, non-sexual moans, inappropriate laughter, and tons of puzzles that will literally blow your brains out...

Having an army of mutated zombies is way better! Take advantage of our mutation system to overcome the enemy’s defences, by creating powerful new zombie types.

Well, just convert Humans to your cause then! You don’t necessary need to bring flowers and be charming, as a single bite right into the neck (or anywhere that pleases you) should be enough to do the trick!<br></li><li><strong>Destructible Environments:</strong> In times of a zombie apocalypse, humans love to take their time playing hide and seek.

  "detailed_description": "<strong>SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: The Surgeon General was brutally murdered by STRAFE®. </strong><br><br>STRAFE® is a roguelike first-person shooter that generates unique, full levels every time you play. Hand-crafted rooms are randomly linked together and filled with a fresh buffet of hungry enemies, so every run provides a new bloody challenge as you seamlessly slaughter your way through 4 diverse locations in unknown deep space. With secrets hidden around every corner and plenty of mechanics to discover, the tutorial is just the start — so explore &amp; experiment often!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong> STRAFE®'S FEATURES: </strong></h2><br><strong>PERMANENT DAMAGE AND GIBS!</strong> ÜBER-GORE technology means enemies explode with fountains of blood, which never fades away. Create wicked works of death art that mark your explored territory from the unventured. <br><br><strong>ENDLESS CHANGING LEVELS!</strong> Randomly-generated levels are always different and violently unpredictable. Rooms, enemies, power ups, monster closets, and secrets move around every time you die! <br><br><strong>FACE MELTING SPEED!</strong> The blazing fast action will hit you like the blast wave of a 50 megaton thermonuclear warhead, liquefying your skin cells and rupturing your internal organs. Yet still leave you coming back for more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2>As a Scrapper on a impossibly dangerous mission at the edge of the galaxy, you only have one life to navigate all the nightmarish terrains of STRAFE®. When you die, nothing will ever be the same again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STRAFE® ALSO INCLUDES:</strong></h2>+ Four unique zones (three levels each) that demand different death-defying gameplay styles<br>+ Gun upgrades that turn your average tool of death into an outright murder machine <br>+ 30+ insane weapons <br>+ 20+ blood-thirsty enemies <br>+ Some of the most unique secrets in gaming! <br>+ The sickest soundtrack of 1996 and at least the next 25 years<br>+ Unsigned 32 bit colors!<br>+ Lifelike digital gravity<br>+ Colored lighting!<br>+ STRAFE®!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAME MODES</h2> <br>+CAMPAIGN - The core experience is a single player roguelike FPS adventure filled with secrets. <br>+STRAFE ZONE - A leaderboard based daily challenge. You have one attempt to get the high score each day, can you do it?<br>+SPEED ZONE - A leaderboard based weekly challenge. You have a week to run a locked level seed as many times as you want and try to shave your time down but you have to kill 90% of the enemies in the level before you can cross the finish line. <br>+MURDER ZONE - Can you survive 10 rooms of slaughter? Unlock new tools between attempts to become ruthlessly efficient.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WHAT STRAFE® IS NOT</strong><br></h2>We don't want you to buy STRAFE® if it's not a game you'd enjoy. We'd rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. This is what STRAFE® isn't:<br> <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a traditional shooter or a &quot;Quake Clone&quot; </strong> - STRAFE®  pays homage to many classic shooters, and it features many of the classic elements of old school shooters but STRAFE® is a roguelike. This means that it was designed from the ground up for replayability and randomization. Every room in STRAFE® was designed by hand and is seamlessly connected by our level generator to create unique experiences.<br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® does not have lives or checkpoints</strong> - As a roguelike, if you die in STRAFE® you will start at the beginning of the game and everything will randomize. The game is balanced around this idea to avoid frustration. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a multiplayer game</strong> - There is no multiplayer deathmatch or co-op in STRAFE®.

  "about_the_game": "<strong>SURGEON GENERAL’S WARNING: The Surgeon General was brutally murdered by STRAFE®. </strong><br><br>STRAFE® is a roguelike first-person shooter that generates unique, full levels every time you play. Hand-crafted rooms are randomly linked together and filled with a fresh buffet of hungry enemies, so every run provides a new bloody challenge as you seamlessly slaughter your way through 4 diverse locations in unknown deep space. With secrets hidden around every corner and plenty of mechanics to discover, the tutorial is just the start — so explore &amp; experiment often!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong> STRAFE®'S FEATURES: </strong></h2><br><strong>PERMANENT DAMAGE AND GIBS!</strong> ÜBER-GORE technology means enemies explode with fountains of blood, which never fades away. Create wicked works of death art that mark your explored territory from the unventured. <br><br><strong>ENDLESS CHANGING LEVELS!</strong> Randomly-generated levels are always different and violently unpredictable. Rooms, enemies, power ups, monster closets, and secrets move around every time you die! <br><br><strong>FACE MELTING SPEED!</strong> The blazing fast action will hit you like the blast wave of a 50 megaton thermonuclear warhead, liquefying your skin cells and rupturing your internal organs. Yet still leave you coming back for more.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STORY</strong></h2>As a Scrapper on a impossibly dangerous mission at the edge of the galaxy, you only have one life to navigate all the nightmarish terrains of STRAFE®. When you die, nothing will ever be the same again.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>STRAFE® ALSO INCLUDES:</strong></h2>+ Four unique zones (three levels each) that demand different death-defying gameplay styles<br>+ Gun upgrades that turn your average tool of death into an outright murder machine <br>+ 30+ insane weapons <br>+ 20+ blood-thirsty enemies <br>+ Some of the most unique secrets in gaming! <br>+ The sickest soundtrack of 1996 and at least the next 25 years<br>+ Unsigned 32 bit colors!<br>+ Lifelike digital gravity<br>+ Colored lighting!<br>+ STRAFE®!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">GAME MODES</h2> <br>+CAMPAIGN - The core experience is a single player roguelike FPS adventure filled with secrets. <br>+STRAFE ZONE - A leaderboard based daily challenge. You have one attempt to get the high score each day, can you do it?<br>+SPEED ZONE - A leaderboard based weekly challenge. You have a week to run a locked level seed as many times as you want and try to shave your time down but you have to kill 90% of the enemies in the level before you can cross the finish line. <br>+MURDER ZONE - Can you survive 10 rooms of slaughter? Unlock new tools between attempts to become ruthlessly efficient.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>WHAT STRAFE® IS NOT</strong><br></h2>We don't want you to buy STRAFE® if it's not a game you'd enjoy. We'd rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. This is what STRAFE® isn't:<br> <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a traditional shooter or a &quot;Quake Clone&quot; </strong> - STRAFE®  pays homage to many classic shooters, and it features many of the classic elements of old school shooters but STRAFE® is a roguelike. This means that it was designed from the ground up for replayability and randomization. Every room in STRAFE® was designed by hand and is seamlessly connected by our level generator to create unique experiences.<br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® does not have lives or checkpoints</strong> - As a roguelike, if you die in STRAFE® you will start at the beginning of the game and everything will randomize. The game is balanced around this idea to avoid frustration. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not a multiplayer game</strong> - There is no multiplayer deathmatch or co-op in STRAFE®. But we recommend Quake Live if you are looking for a great old school arena shooter. <br><br><strong>+ STRAFE® is not limited to the design decisions of 1996</strong> - What can I say?

Each run through the procedurally sequenced mines and temples offers a unique path through a variety of challenges against upgraded enemy combatants and three intense boss fights.<br><br><strong>Faejin Combat Style:</strong> The nw Faejin Combat Style blends defense and offense with percussive strikes and fluid power. The new approach is a complex style for experienced Absolvers, featuring shifting defensive abilities and two dozen attacks for bare hands, wargloves, and armed combat.<br><br><strong>School Challenges:</strong> Absolvers who have reached the Disciple rank in a school can participate in School challenges, by using their school’s decks and powers in 1v1 Combat Trials. All wins representing one’s school count in the School challenges, with individual and collective performances of the schools bringing fresh rewards every three weeks, at the end of the season.</p><br><h1>Digital Deluxe Edition</h1><p><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/473690/extras/AbsolverDeluxe.png?t=1538944712\" ><br>The Absolver: Deluxe Edition includes the official soundtrack from Austin Wintory and The Art of Absolver 52-page digital artbook.</p><br><h1>About the Game</h1>In the ruins of the fallen Adal Empire, you awaken with a mysterious mask on your face, and faint recollections of an esoteric ceremony. Freeing you from hunger, thirst, and even death, the mask is the creation of the Guides, the rulers of these lands, who have placed you here to determine whether you are worthy of becoming part of the elite corps of Absolvers. As you wander these forsaken lands, encountering other Prospects like you, you will learn new combat styles, acquire weapons, gear and armor, and build a team of warriors with whom to fight side by side in Arenas of combat.<br><br>Please visit the official Absolver FAQ on the Steam discussion board for more information: <a href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/app/473690/discussions/0/2579854400733819593/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >http://steamcommunity.com/app/473690/discussions/0/2579854400733819593/</a><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/473690/extras/AbsolverHype.png?t=1538944712\" ></h2><br><br><strong>Fluid Real-Time Combat: </strong>Position yourself in one of four tactical stances during real-time battles and execute devastating attacks, dodges, and parries.

These moments are filled with tension as intentions to battle or befriend are never clear: trust is always a leap of faith.

There are feels here that hit out of the blue.”<br><a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/12/15/purrfect-date-left-me-feline-funny\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Kotaku</a><br><br>“Purrfect Date takes the visual novel, dating simulator genre and takes it in a whole other direction.

And then splurge on the amazing free Cube Escapes, each of which adds to the Rusty Lake universe in a peculiar way. You’ll be so glad you did.”<br><a href=\"https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/24/rusty-lake-roots-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun</a><br><br>“Rusty Lake: Roots is an excellent follow-up to Rusty Lake Hotel—grander, grimmer, and more gruesome than ever. The Rusty Lake games are quickly carving out a niche as my favorite point-and-click series of the modern era, with a bold confidence underpinning their unconventional and inventive world. I highly recommend picking up the pair for a night or two of surreal horror.”<br>4/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/3136358/software/rusty-lake-roots-review-a-grim-sequel-for-one-of-2016s-best-surprises.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >PCWorld</a><br><br>“That payoff is the same as any great Rusty Lake game: the ability to lose yourself in the strange and disturbing events unfolding before you. An empathy for and understanding of even characters that don’t speak a word. A frustration and then exhilaration at solving brain-burning puzzles. And an increased appreciation, love, and fear of Rusty Lake and its shadowy, timeless inhabitants. Roots just happens to have all of this in an even larger, longer package; with more lives on the line; and more reasons to book your stay.”<br>4.5/5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamezebo.com/2016/11/01/rusty-lake-roots-review-hello-brother/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameZebo</a><br>",

We have the best players in the world and we are privileged to serve you. <br><br>Update 1.1.0 for PC/Steam brings the heat! Challenge your friends, enemies and other players online. Game on! Friends matchmaking is here. With the new Challenge feature, you’ll be able to directly challenge another player to a game on the Playgrounds. All you have to do is agree on a code, open the online mode, switch to Challenges, enter that code and face each other. <br><br>Other additions include a new connection manager, which monitors the connection of players during ranked matches and penalizes disconnections from games that are made to avoid losing.

  "reviews": "“It's rare to play something so pure, a multiplayer game with modern sensibilities and yet one that feels like it was forged in the fire of older arcade classics. If there's any justice, Laser League is a game that'll find its place among those greats.”<br>Essential – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-11-laser-league-review-an-instant-modern-day-multiplayer-classic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Eurogamer</a><br><br>“Laser League is phenomenal. It’s easy to pick up, thoroughly appealing in its style, and dangerously captivating. It builds on the team game chops that made Rocket League so successful, yet turns it into something utterly unique and tense.”<br>9/10 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/10/laser-league-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >Sixth Axis</a><br><br>“Roll7's latest is its best game to date, a future-sport humdinger that carries itself with the nonchalant assurance of the studios previous work, with a layer of refinement that pushes it a step beyond them. Laser League feels like a high-quality remake of a classic arcade game that never existed, its fierce arena battles playing like a combination of dodgeball and Tron, with just a hint of Robotron in the way you find yourself navigating perilously tight spaces.”<br>9/10 – EDGE<br>",

This is another game harkening back to the days of speed and dodging projectiles, and it feels excellent.”<br>8.5 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://techraptor.net/content/immortal-redneck-review-lon-chaingun-jr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >TechRaptor</a><br><br>“The combat is fast, fun, and incredibly satisfying, often involving frantic dashes, flying leaps, and sudden evasive manoeuvres when it becomes clear that reloading is necessary.”<br>8 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://www.gamespew.com/2017/04/immortal-redneck-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpew</a><br><br>“Combat is explosive and addictive, with gunplay feeling smoother than butter. Rather than avoid encounters I found myself actively seeking them out, not only because shooting mummies in the face is satisfying but also because doing it with a shotgun put a smile on my face.”<br>9 – <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://www.gamerassaultweekly.com/2017/04/immortal-redneck-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GamerAssaultWeekly</a><br>",
